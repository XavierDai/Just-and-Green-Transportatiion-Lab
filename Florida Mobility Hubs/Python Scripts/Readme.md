# Analysis Process Folder - Python Scripts

This folder contains Python code used in the mobility hub projects.
## Overview

The processes in this folder involve conducting non-spatial data analysis and certain spatial data analyses not addressed in ArcGIS. The codes are structured to perform specific tasks.

## Contents

- **GTFS_process**: Process the GTFS data.
- **transit_ridership_and_supply**: Calculate the transit index.
- **socioeconomic, socioeconomic_access_road**: Calculate the sub criteria for the socioeconomic index, the accessibility index, and the infrastructure index.
- **fmlm_gap_score**: Calculate the fmlm_gap score, a sub criterion in the FM/LM connectivity index.
- **microtransit_fmlm**: Calculate the micro_transit_fmlm score, a sub criterion in the FM/LM connectivity index.
- **index_calculation**: Calculate the five indexes.
- **site_selection**: Calculate the final mobility hub score. With an algorithm, iteratively identify hub locations based on the mobility hub score calculated.
