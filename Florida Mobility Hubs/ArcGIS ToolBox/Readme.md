# Analysis Process Folder - ArcGIS Toolbox

This folder contains the ArcGIS Toolbox developed for the the mobility hub project.

## Overview

The Toolbox in this folder involves tools that conduct spatial data analysis in ArcGIS. The tools are structured to perform specific tasks:


- **spatial_units**: Clustering the bus stops with DBSCAN algorithm, and generate spatial units.
- **microtransit_scooter**: Calculate the fmlm connectivity criterion of the spatial units.
- **join_infrastructure**: Clip and assign infrastructure to the spatial units.
- **join_census**: Assign the census data to the spatial units.
- **walk_score**: Extract the walkable score of the spatial units.
